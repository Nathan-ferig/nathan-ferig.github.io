This project was part of an online course on Git & Github. This course was delivered by The Geek University and hosted at Udemy and can be found [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/curso-de-git-e-github-essencial/ "Git & Github essencial para o desenvolvedor"). The code was provide by the course instructors and can be found [here](https://github.com/felicityBR/felicityBR.github.io "Code repository"). I've built upon this code, modifying it to attend my needs. 

It was a interesting excercise in *html* and *css* and I'm proud of the results I've achieved with this code.
Thank you,
